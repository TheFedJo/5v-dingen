# ‘Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.’

Father is of different kinds; as the political, the ancient, the spiritual, the domestic, and the natural.

# Political father, the magistrate

Their place deserves honour. God has promoted kings, that they may promote justice. We have to pray for them, that they may be blessings.

# The grave, ancient father

These fathers have to be honoured for their seniority and especially (if they are pious) for their piety. Honour an old man who is serving God by reverencing and imitating him. 

# The spiritual fathers, as pastors and ministers

These fathers are to be honoured in respect of their office, they are messengers of the Lord. Honour them by (1) giving them respect, (2) advocating for them and (3) believe and obey their doctrine. 

# The domestic father, the master

Although a master might not be as qualified as he should be, the servant must not neglect his duty and honour him in a certain way. A servant should (1) obey his master in things that are lawful and honest, (2) be diligent in his service, (3) honour his master by being faithful and (4) serve him without replying. Meanwhile masters have to (1) take care to provide for their servants, (2) encourage them in their work, (4) not overburden them, (5) seek their spiritual good, (6) be very exact and punctual in agreements you make with them and (7) be careful with them in health and sickness. 

# The natural father

Honour thy natural father. Children are to honour their parents by reverential esteem, inwardly, by fear mixed with love and outwardly, both in word and gesture.  Secondly children have to show honour by careful obedience in (1) listening to their advice, (2) complying with their commands and (3) relieving their wants. Why should children honour their parents? (1) It’s God’s command, (2) they deserve it as respect for the love and affection they show to their children and (3) honouring your father and your mother is well-pleasing to the Lord. 

If we should honour our earthly father, we should honour our heavenly Father even more. Our heavenly Father wants to be honoured by (1) obedience, (2) advocating of His cause, (3) ascribing honour of all we do to Him, (4) celebrating His praise and (5) suffering dishonour or even death for His sake. God is worthy of honour. Be living commentaries on this commandment, children by honouring their parents and parents have to act in that way, that they may gain honour from their children.

How should parents act to gain honour from their children? (1) Be careful to bring your children up in the fear and nurture of the Lord, (2) keep up parental authority, be kind but don’t spoil them, (3) provide for your children what is fitting, (4) put them to some lawful calling wherein they may serve their generation and act (5) lovingly and (6) prudently towards them. 

How may a parent provoke his children to wrath? By (1) giving them abusing terms, (2) strike them without cause, (3) deny them the things that are absolutely needed, (4) by showing one child more love than another, (5) by doing anything that is shameful and unworthy and by (6) giving them commandments that are wrong to do. What a good parent should do is (7) pray much for them, (8) encourage the good things in your child and (9) set them a good example.
