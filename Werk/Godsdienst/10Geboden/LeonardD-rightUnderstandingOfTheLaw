#  4. The right understanding of the law
Thomas Watson starts this chapter with the question: ‘’What is the difference between the moral law and the gospel?’’ The answer to this question is: Firstly, the law requires us that we worship God as our Creator, whereas the gospel, that we worship God in and through Christ. Secondly, the moral law requires obedience, and gives no strength. However, instead the gospel gives strength as it sweetens the law.

# Of what use is the moral law to us?

A glass to show us our sins, to bring us to Christ (‘’The law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ’’ –Galatians 3:24 –). But is the moral law still in force to believers; is it not abolished to them? We are to live according to the law, however, we should trust Christ’s righteousness for justification. We must not think that we can fulfil the law by ourselves. The law is not a Saviour to us, but a guide.

# Rules for right understanding of the law

1.       The commands and prohibitions of the moral law reach the heart.
2.       In the commandments there is a synecdoche – more is intended than is spoken.
3.       Where any sin is forbidden in the commandment, the occasion of it is also forbidden.
4.       Where one relation is named in the commandment, there another relation is included.
5.       Where greater sins are forbidden, lesser sins are also forbidden.
6.       The law of God is entire.
7.       God’s law forbids not only the acting of sin in our own people – but being accessory to, or having any hand in, the sins of others. 
8.       The last rule about the commandments is, that though we cannot, by our own strength, fulfill all these commandments, yet doing what we are able, the Lord has provided encouragement for us.

# As we cannot, by our own strength, fulfil these commandments, God gave a threefold encouragement for us.

1.       That though we have not ability to obey any one command – yet God has in the new covenant, promised to work that in us which he requires.  
2.       Though we cannot exactly fulfil the moral law, yet God for Christ’s sake will mitigate the rigour of the law, and accept of something less than he requires. God in the law requires exact obedience; he will abate something of the degree. If there be truth in the inward parts. He will see the faith, and pass by the failing. The gospel remits the severity of the moral law.
3.       Wherein our personal obedience comes short, God will be pleased to accept us in our Surety. That very service which God’s law might condemn, his mercy is pleased to crown, by virtue of the blood of our Mediator.
