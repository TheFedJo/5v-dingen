# 5. The 8th commandment

# ‘’Thou shalt not steal’’ Exodus 20:15

Why is mankind inclined to steal? There are two kind of causes, the internal and the external causes.

# Internal causes:

-Unbelief. A man has a distrust of God’s providence, and therefore he provides himself with stolen goods.
-Covetousness. A man covets more than his own, and this itch of covetousness makes him scratch what he can from another.

# External causes:
-Satan’s solicitation. Judas was a thief, because Satan entered into him.

# There are two kinds of stealing:

-Stealing from God, which indicates the robbing of the Sabbath.
-Stealing from others:
--The highway thief, for example someone who takes a purse.
--The house-thief, steals his master’s cash or steals his wares. He is hypocrite to, as he pretends to be helping his master, whereas he helps himself.
--The thief that steals from his clients, by deceit and prevarication.
--The church-thief or pluralist, who holds several benefices, but seldom or never preaches to the people.
--The shop-thief, who steals in selling. He who uses false weights and measures steals from others what is their due.
--The usurer, who takes by extortion from others. He seems to help another by letting him have money in his necessity, but gets him into bonds, and sucks out his very blood and marrow.
--The trustee, who has the orphan’s estate committed to him, is deputed to be his guardian, and manages his estate for him; if he curtails the estate, and gets the fleece out of it for himself, and wrongs the orphan, he is a thief.
--The borrower, who borrows money from others, with an intention never to pay them again.
--The last sort of theft is, the receiver of stolen goods. The receiver, if he be not the principal, yet is accessory to the theft, and the law makes him guilty.

# What are the aggravations of this sin?

-To steal when there is no need; to be a rich thief.
-To steal sacrilegiously, to devour things to set apart to holy uses.
-To commit the sin of theft against checks of conscience, and examples of God’s justice.
-To rob the widow and orphan.
-To rob the poor.

# A man can be a thief to himself in this way:

-By niggardliness. The niggard is a thief, he steals from himself in not allowing himself what is needful.
-A man may rob himself by foolishly wasting his estate.
-He is a thief to himself, by idleness, when he mis-spends his time.
-A man may be a thief to himself by suretyship.

What is to be done to avoid stealing?

-Live in calling, the devil hires such as stand idle, and puts them to the pilfering trade. An idle person tempts the devil to tempt him.

-Be content with the estate that God has given you.
