Text:
Matthew 5: 38-42
38 Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth:
39 But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.
40 And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also.
41 And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain.
42 Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away.

Summary:
Many people have gone wrong on this particular piece of text. Some become immersed into the details, others claim this and the Sermon on the mount in general do not contain doctrine, only practical advice. This is far from the truth. It is not important to be able to turn the cheek, but your general attitude of self should be different. Man by nature is ready to defend himself, however this is not Christian. We should become indifferent to our own interests. Ryle adds that we should be like our Father.  George Muller once said he died to the world, his friends and then himself. This sequence is very important. Obviously, it is easy to ignore the world, however ignoring your friends and yourself becomes increasingly difficult. A gentleman, according to the world, is not afraid to defend himself and his interests. This aggressive type of person is not Christian. A Christian has died to himself and Christ lives in him. Every instance of unhappiness is caused by separation from Christ and defending the interests of self. Just like Jesus never defended his own self and finally sacrificed himself on the cross to not save himself but for us. We should abandon our selfsensitivity and devote ourselves to God.

Evaluation:
LLoyd-Jones is very radical on this point and I mean this in a positive way. He does not dive into the details but instead digs up the deeper and broader message to not be so worried about ourselves, our future, our looks and our other interests. He makes it clear that this self-obsession is deeply rooted in our nature and daily life makes you look at your own actions. This is probably even more relevant in the present day, as our society is increasingly more geared towards the individual and less towards the family, the church or other community. In addition, being assertive is praised, just like giving in is frowned upon. Lloyd-Jones and Ryle provide a sharper than ever contrast between being Christian and living like the world wants you to.  

Questions:
How does Martyn Lloyd-Jones view self-confidence?
Who is George Muller?
 - George Muller was born in Germany but moved to England where he became known for his organization which supported orphanages and missionary work all over the world.


Thesis:
Here Jesus officially denounces the laws of the Old Testament.
In the verses above Jesus says that instead of returning evil for evil, you should turn your other cheek.

Jesus does denounce the negative connotation which was used by the Pharisees as an excuse to take revenge, however this was not the way the text was meant in Exodus or Leviticus. This does not mean that all laws from the Old Testament are still to be strictly followed.
